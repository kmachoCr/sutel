This classification is shown in the following image.</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 2. General Service Classification</div><img class="visible-lg visible-md" alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura2-lg.png"><div class=" visible-xs visible-sm table-responsive"><img alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura2-sm.png" width="500" height="153"></div><div class="metodologia_ref">Source: Prioprietary</div><div class="metodologia_p">This service classification includes the public telecommunication networks that carry voice, data and television signals, as these have the ability to provide various telecommunication services.<br><br>Four general service categories were created, in order to define the analysis and the processing of the information provided;namely, mobile and fixed telephone services for voice signals, data transfer for transmitting packets over Internet Protocol and subscription TV networks that carry television signals. The following briefly describes the function and architecture of each one of these services.</div><div class="metodologia_h2">Mobile Telephones</div><div class="metodologia_p">Mobile phone networks began to develop as of 1979, when NTT in Japan deployed the first analog cellular system for voice transmission. Ever since then, networks have undergone significant changes, mainly because these first generation systems would not operate together (interoperability).<br><br>The most widely deployed systems, in this first generation, were the Advanced Mobile Phone Systems (AMPS) in the United States and Total Access Communications Systems (TACS) in Europe, both used modulation frequency for radio transmission.<br><br>By the end of the 80s, the second generation systems appear, with the particularity that they supported data transfer at low speeds. These systems were based on the technologies of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), in order to improve the spectrum efficiency, to provide data services and to enhance the roaming services.<br><br>The most widely accepted standard was the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), which remains operable in many parts of the world. <br><br>This standard remained in development and evolved into the 2.5G generation, thanks to the standardized design of devices such as the BSC (Base Station Controller) and MSC (Mobile Switching Center), including the commercially successful SMSC (Short Message Service Centre) and the consolidation of the PCN (Packet Core Network), which was made ​​possible thanks to the deployment of the GPRS (General Packet Radio Services) technology. This technology provided the capabilities needed to establish better connection times, the ability to charge for traffic and higher speeds for wireless access to the network.<br><br>In the following image, the standard architecture of a second generation system is shown, portraying the access and core elements.</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 3. Network Architecture for a 2G System</div><img class="visible-lg visible-md" alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura3-lg.png"><div class=" visible-xs visible-sm table-responsive"><img alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura3-sm.png" width="500" height="164"></div><div class="metodologia_ref">Source: Prioprietary</div><div class="metodologia_p">Subsequently, the passage to the third generation mobile networks came with the development of the technology for data transmission EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates in GSM Environment), which increased the volume of traffic on the air interface;the packet behavior of packets on this interface remained similar to that of a call in the circuit switched network. At this point in time, it was necessary for the design of the technological platform for mobile networks to be governed by a global standard, which resulted in the release of the IMT-2000 by the International Telecommunications Union, whose requirements were consolidated in the first version of the WCDMA specifications developed by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) in the so called Release 99.<br><br>The architecture of third generation systems suffered significant changes in the access network, particularly in devices such as the Node B and RNC (Radio Network Controller), but also in Core Components, such as the SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node), which was modified for transferring, tunneling and packet routing and for managing mobility between areas and data billing. Also, a service control layer called IMS (Internet and Multimedia Subsystem) was created, which came to increase the functionality of the 3G networks.</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 4. Network Architecture for a 3G System</div><img class="visible-lg visible-md" alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura4-lg.png"><div class=" visible-xs visible-sm table-responsive"><img alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura4-sm.png" width="500" height="159"></div><div class="metodologia_ref">Source: Prioprietary</div><div class="metodologia_p">Overall, the new features of these systems were competitive benefits for 3G networks, due to the reduced latency, greater spectral efficiency by better utilizing the spectrum, increased coverage, lower operating costs and increased data transfer rate.<br><br>The fact that users had access to a greater ability to send and receive data, generated an increase in demand which led manufacturers, research centers and operators to continue the evolution of mobile phone systems, in order to take advantage of the trend in the convergence of services and networks over the Internet Protocol (all-IP architectures). All of this, added to 3GPP’s Release 8 on the evolution of this system architecture, initiated the development of the 4th Generation Systems, commonly called LTE (Long Term Evolution), from which we expect a further provision of mobile services, broadband access to data, lower costs in the transport of voice, unified messaging and greater flexibility for roaming. At the same time, 4G systems are expected to become an engine for economic and social development, so their deployment has been accelerated in different parts of the world. The first commercial 4G network that sprung into operation was opened by TeliaSonera in Oslo and Stockholm in 2009. By November 2012 there were 113 networks in 51 countries.<br><br>These 4G networks have achieved the operational requirements of the IMT-Advanced, including: peak rate of 1Gbps for data transfer in the downlink and 500 Mbps in the uplink, downlink spectrum efficiency of 15 bps / Hz and 6.75 bps / Hz in the uplink, mobility up to 350 km / h, scalable bandwidth, spectrum aggregation and ability to operate up to 40 MHz channels. The following image shows the architecture of these 4G systems.</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 5. Network Architecture for a 4G System</div><img class="visible-lg visible-md" alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura5-lg.png"><div class=" visible-xs visible-sm table-responsive"><img alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura5-sm.png" width="500" height="113"></div><div class="metodologia_ref">Source: Prioprietary</div><div class="metodologia_h2">Fixed Telephone Lines</div><div class="metodologia_p">In general, fixed telephone lines can be described as the service associated to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), which for decades remained to be the most popular method for communication due to its simplicity and ease of installation.<br><br>Named after the way in which calls are established, the terminals remain offline until they try to link to other terminals that have marked the corresponding phone number. To do this, temporary connections are enabled, which may vary according to the amount and the merits of the requests, this is known as circuit switching.<br><br>The most common topology is to have a series of hierarchical centrals in charge of switching between subscribers connected to the local loop. Generally, the PSTN is composed of access elements from the user terminal, the dispersion box and the wiring of twisted copper pairs (local loop), all the way to the distributors and intelligent switches that link the centrals and route calls. The following image shows a general breakdown of the elements within the PSTN architecture for by circuit switch (traditional basic telephone services).</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 6. Elements of a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)</div><img class="visible-lg visible-md" alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura6-lg.png"><div class=" visible-xs visible-sm table-responsive"><img alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura6-sm.png" width="500" height="225"></div><div class="metodologia_ref">Source: Prioprietary</div><div class="metodologia_p">The hierarchical model of the Central Offices reduces the number of trunks (usually E1 digital links with transmission rates of 2.048 Mbps and SS7 signaling) and is distributed in primary centrals connecting calls outside of the defined geographical areas;toll switches that manage traffic between termination points associated with various local stations and local stations which are located in the local loop, the closest point to the subscriber.<br><br>Some regulatory authorities in different countries have defined fixed phone lines as a publicly available service, which consists of the commercial exploitation of activities that allow the transport of voice, where the originating communication terminal is connected to a point of fixed network terminal. This divided the fixed phone lines into basic traditional phones and public phones, where traditional basic telephones commercially exploit the voice through terminals connected at some point in the network. This has allowed the development of other services, both voice and data in the area of telephone services, like Voice over Internet Protocol or VoIP.<br><br>The VoIP service began to grow in the world, sue to how useful it was for companies with large traffic consumption and high operating costs, related to telecommunications. Its technological implementation began after the International Telecommunications Union released its H.323 recommendation for audiovisual communications over Packet Switched Networks. The massive deployment of this service was accelerated with the introduction of the SoftSwitch in the market (smart device, for the management and control of calls, which allows for the integration with the PSTN, while maintaining the scalability, reliability and quality of service). Another important item is the Gateway, which has two components, the Media Gateway and the Gateway Controller, that facilitate the interoperability with the connected networks and the signaling. The following image summarizes the implementation of the VoIP architecture and its connection to the fixed telephone network.</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 7. Integration of the VoIP Service with the PSTN</div><img class="visible-lg visible-md" alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura7-lg.png"><div class=" visible-xs visible-sm table-responsive"><img alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura7-sm.png" width="500" height="297"></div><div class="metodologia_ref">Source: Prioprietary</div><div class="metodologia_h2">Subscription TV</div><div class="metodologia_p">In the late 1940s, television companies in the United States adopted the coaxial cable interface to modify their content provision service in one way. Ever since then, their business model has evolved along with the advances of technology, which allow transmitting voice, video and data, turning the cable TV operators into telecommunications service providers.<br><br>Currently, the access network for the subscription TV service is built on a hybrid network between coaxial and fiber optic, called HFC. This network, in particular, uses a tree and branch architecture with two-way transmission, with spacing between modems ranging from 24 km to 80 km and a maximum propagation delay of 0.8 ms, in which the maximum distance to the CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System) is 80 km.<br><br>The typical configuration for a cable TV network, capable of providing telecommunication services, is shown in the following image. This image shows the main elements of the system.</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 8.

The objective of this implementation comes to address the need for increased bandwidth capacity, speeds, scalability, as well as improving the network maintenance practices and offer new services.<br><br>In regards to the radio frequency, a window is used for the downstream, its lower limit may be at 54 MHz, 87.5 MHz, 108 MHz or 258 MHz and its upper limit is in the range of 550 MHz to 1002 MHz. For the upstream, windows are used which lower limit is between 5-42 MHz, 5-65 MHz, 5-85 MHz, 5-117 MHz or the 5-204 MHz, their upper limit is always higher than 204 MHz.<br><br>The satellite or ground video signals over the air, which are within this range of frequency are received at the HeadEnd and combined with the local content to be modulated and then transmitted over fiber, in order to minimize losses over long distances. Then, the signal conversion is performed in the nodes, in order to be transmitted in analog manner with the coaxial cable segments, which require amplification to maintain the signal quality for all users.<br><br>The HFC network is able to provide bidirectional communication;the fiber portion alone could do it, using two wires for this, while the coaxial uses frequency division duplexing to accomplish the downstream and upstream on the same medium;therefore, the amplifiers must also be bidirectional. Furthermore, a 6 MHz channel is reserved for data and a 64-QAM modulation is applied to obtain an available bandwidth of 30 Mbps in the downstream. On the other hand, for the upstream, where lower bandwidth is required, a modulation with QPSK and 16 QAM is used. The RF signals are converted into digital signals in the CMTS;special attention must be paid to prevent collisions in the transmission when using CSMA / CD, because the bandwidth is shared among all the cable modems. The detail of this network architecture is shown in the following image.</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 9. Network Architecture of Subscription TV, which facilitates Data Transmission</div><img class="visible-lg visible-md" alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura9-lg.png"><div class=" visible-xs visible-sm table-responsive"><img alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura9-sm.png" width="500" height="309"></div><div class="metodologia_ref">Source: Prioprietary</div><div class="metodologia_h2">Data Transfer</div><div class="metodologia_p">This category of service includes all the packet switching networks and all those systems, that in order to enable their services, use the Internet Protocol, other routing protocols or both in their network layer.<br><br>By packet switching method, we mean the method that allows any data stream transmitted over a digital broadcast to become small structures called packets, which in addition to the information they carry, carry with them a wealth of additional information that they use to tell switches to where they need to move forward. Moreover, a switch is a device, which through specialized software, receives packets arriving from certain links, processes and forwards them to their destination on other links.<br><br>In general, packet switching exploits the ability of the switches (or routers) for multiplexing and demultiplexing the data frames belonging to different sessions of data transfer between different computer networks that are interconnected through physical links, whose capacity can be shared by multiple users.<br><br>Significantly, the packet switching networks can be differentiated by considering two aspects: the transmission of datagrams and the configuration of virtual circuits. <br><br>The path information is not known for switching datagrams -also called connectionless-, because the packages are broken and routed by different links until reordered at the destination. Also, virtual circuits achieve that packets follow the same route;the said route is selected from the beginning of the session, although this makes the transmission less flexible and it does require a dedicated link. This type of communication decreases the calculations in the active devices and provides a degree of safety known from the beginning. Examples of this technology are Frame Relay, ATM, MPLS and VCI, which despite their differences allow for the linking of their functionality to services in the transport layer and also provide services between the data layer and the network layer, such as virtual private circuits and others of the like.<br><br>The routing of datagrams normally uses the IP protocol and its implementation has spread from Local Area Networks (LANs) to Wide Area Networks (WAN);while other protocols, like BGP, have been implemented for transportation between autonomous systems, which has allowed the development of multiple modalities for accessing the internet and international transport services, peer-to-peer and many more. In short, packet switching offers advantages such as efficient data management, the ability to provide variable bandwidth, the ability to generate routing tables;they provide simplicity and quality of service.<br><br>However, the development of these technologies allowed for the deployment of networks that are capable of transmitting information through a set of technologies that link the routing part of the information with its transport, e.g. how a Virtual Circuit Network manages to connect two routers in different LAN IP-based networks.<br><br>To better understand the relationship between routing and transport, a conceptual model was developed, in which the data flow necessary for establishing communication is divided into 7 different layers. This model developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO) is known as the OSI model (Open System Interconnection). Based on the latter, the relationship between routing and transport can be identified and derived.<br><br>This model consists of various functionalities in its 7 layers. Each layer provides services to the layer above it (top layer) and receives services from the layer below it (bottom layer).<br><br>Communication is established between layers of the same level. That’s why layer 3 of a computer in a network communicates only with layer 3 of other computers in the same network.</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 10. OSI Model Representation</div><img class="visible-lg visible-md" alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura10-lg.png"><div class=" visible-xs visible-sm table-responsive"><img alt="" src="_images_en/metodologia/figura10-sm.png" width="500" height="210"></div><div class="metodologia_ref">Source: Prioprietary</div><div class="metodologia_p">These layers define functions, but they do not define a specific protocol or type of connection. For each layer there are a number of protocols and interfaces that have been adopted by the telecommunications industry, in order to make communications more effective.<br><br>The OSI Layer Model has been an indispensable reference to conceptualize the telecommunication networks;one of these conceptualizations is the TCP / IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol), which relates the routing and transport portion. This model, also called Internet Model, describes a set of guidelines for the design and implementation of network protocols that allow for a computer to communicate over a Packet Switched Network in the presence of datagrams, virtual circuits, and others. This is possible because the model provides end-to-end connectivity by specifying protocols, data format and addressing, and congestion control, among other functions.<br><br>According to the provisions of the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), in the RFC 1122, a TCP/IP model consists of four layers, not seven. These are: Media Access, Internet, Transport and Application.<br><br>As mentioned before, the Internet layer uses the IP Protocol, in order to provide services of addressing, routing and QoS. The addressing can identify the terminals (hosts) present in the network and facilitates the routing of information between these, using protocols that employ different types of algorithms to choose the route and how to reach a given destination. These protocols are divided into two main classes, Link-State Routing Protocols such as OSPF and IS-IS, and Distance-Vector Routing Protocols, such as RIP and IGRP.<br><br>Moreover, in the transport layer, the most commonly used protocols include TCP (Transport Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). In this layer, a data communication channel is established, in order to allow an end-to-end exchange of data. This data exchange is connection-oriented, using the TCP protocol and using the UDP protocol when connectionless. This relationship between TCP and IP, consolidated the Packet Switched Networks and allowed for the development of globally interconnected communication systems.<br><br>Finally, this entire packet switching architecture is supported by a network infrastructure, known as physical layer in the OSI Reference Model. This infrastructure consists of a number of technology platforms that use different means to provide communication links;among these, there are networks based on fiber optics, on coaxial cable, on a twisted copper pair and even over wireless media. The following image shows a series of interconnected networks based on Packet Switching.</div><div class="metodologia_bold">Figure 11.
